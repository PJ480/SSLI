            <p class="text">
            Government College of Engineering, Kannur, established in 1986, is one of the premier institutes among the Engineering Colleges in Kerala and is affiliated to Abdul Kalam Technological University. Four of our UG programs have been accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).Scheme for Her Empowerment(SHE) of Govt. College of Engineering Kannur was launched in 2018 with a mission for empowering girls in all aspects of engineering and shine bright in their respective fields.
<br>
            SHE GCEK has been at the forefront of student clubs in Government College of Engineering, Kannur since its inception in 2018. Led by vibrant, enthusiastic and pragmatic girl student leaders and experienced faculty advisors, SHE GCEK has been able to provide a platform for students to showcase and improve their skills and talents.The SHE program proposes to enable our girl students to realize how much potential and support they require to be great leaders in technical fields.
          <br>  
            We are very proud to say that Government of Kerala has recognised the initiaties of scheme for her empowerment as a part of technical education and the role that it played in our college.As a part of this,Government has implemented this scheme in all the other 9 Government engineering Colleges and Poly technic colleges in Kerala.
            (details of inauguration)
        <br>    
            We are also organizing a two-day workshop for coordinators of SHE of Government engineering colleges as part of this event, the objective of which is to provide insight and exposure to the working and planning of SHE GCEK.
