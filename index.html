            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <br>
            <p>An evaluation of the available statistics depicts a glowing picture on the academic status of our female students in the state owned engineering colleges. However the unpleasant truth is that a good number of these female academic achievers fail to shine later on in their carrier and   number of alumnae who dwell in the lead roles in jobs are only handful. Numerous studies from the work place have revealed that many    female engineers enter the engineering work place and they choose to leave because of lack of peers and mentors and they fail to occupy technical leadership position. This dire reality has forced us to put some serious thoughts on the puzzling question “Why So Few?”. And we have identified the burning need to take a more assertive role in imparting our women students, the exposure and experience they need to eventually   fulfill their carrier demands and to assume leadership roles facing all challenges.  With this backdrop, the program Scheme for her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)   is envisaged. 
                The program Scheme for Her Empowerment in engineering education (SHE) is now spearheading to empower a large cross-section of girls in the various government engineering colleges and polytechnics spread across the state. It has a vision to cater to three group viz., the   girl students who are presently undergoing engineering, the girls who aspire to be engineers and the women who are already in engineering profession. All the activities of SHE are in alignment with the vision of   “To create professionally Successful and Personally Fulfilled Women Engineers”. 
               Students need to be at the heart of the operation and decision making in all activities of SHE – but having staff involved gives sustainability. The program is planned in the segments   and  first phase of the SHE program   will specifically focus on training and mentoring of  group of  female students who are  on perceived to act as “Peer Leaders” who will propagate and partake in  training  to remaining girls of the engineering colleges and polytechnics.

            <h3>SHORT TERM </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                1.  To promote diverse opportunity to develop technical capabilities and talents among female engineering  students. 
                </p>
                <p>
                2.  To develop student leaders who will be the torch bearers for SHE and to build a self help community for women in engineering in all engineering colleges 
                </p>
                <p>
                3. To initiate a move for women empowerment in the technical education field of Kerala 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>
                    1.  To encourage women   engineers to  take up leadership roles and to have sustained carrier growth 
                </p> 
                <p>
                2.  To promote greater enrolment of girls in engineering and to ensure  higher ratio of employable female engineers 
                </p>
               <p>
                3. To ensure a global platform for women engineers in engineering institutions in  Kerala  to share, grow and support 
               </p>

          <div class="box-container">
            <h2>Mode of Operation</h2>
      <p>   
<br>The SHE program is now being proposed at the state level and support from the government is sought for its expansion and growth. 
The program is seeking funding from government  for continuing its major aims. <br>
The initiators  of SHE program have  also well identified the value of our resourceful alumni therefore we have to ensure their fruitful participation in gathering 
suggestions and information. The other promising contributors to the program are the teaching fraternity, resource peons from external agencies in the engineering 
field and experts from different walks of life. The SHE program also seeks all the support from PTA and the HRD Cell and also other supportive government and 
nongovernmental organisations.

    <h2>Action Plan for SHE</h2>
    <br>
<p>SHE   has a vision to cater to three group viz., the   girls students who are presently undergoing engineering , the girls who aspire to be engineers and the women who are already in engineering profession and proposes to function in three  phases  . 
    The phase 1 proposes to to enable our girl students to realize how much potential and support they have to be great leaders in technical fields. And involves the following stages major step of starting  SHE in all  engineering colleges/polytechnics , with the  identification of potential coordinators and with the hand holding from SHE-GCEK. The major steps    which involved are,
  <br>   1.	Connecting to the Alumnae of each college  
  <br>  2.	Feedback from the Alumnae of each college
  <br>  3.	Selecting the Target group of each college 
  <br>  4.	SWOT analysis for the Target group
  <br>  5.	Training Need analysis for the target group
    Based on the SWOT and TNA and Alumane survey a program outline is to  charted out.
